 Wonderful project been developed by myself to help the community to  iterate through colours and display or change the color of an element after 2sec.
HOW TO USE:
1: Firstly create a nice template on your html and input any name you want on your h1 tag.eg CHANGE MY COLOUR WITH JAVASCRIPT.
2: secondly give an id to the element on your HTML.then get it by it's elementById.
